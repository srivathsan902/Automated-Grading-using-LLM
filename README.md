# Automated Grading System

Welcome to the Automated Grading System! This project leverages advanced natural language processing models (LLama, Gemma, Mixtral) to automate the grading process, generate prompts, evaluate answers, and create feedback reports. The system integrates with a database and provides a user-friendly UI for both students and instructors.

## Features

- **Prompt Generation**: Automatically generate prompts for questions.
- **Answer Evaluation**: Use LLama, Gemma, and Mixtral models to evaluate student answers.
- **Feedback Reports**: Create detailed feedback reports for each student.
- **Database Integration**: Store and manage questions, answers, and reports in a database.
- **User Interface**: Intuitive UI for students to submit answers and instructors to manage questions.
